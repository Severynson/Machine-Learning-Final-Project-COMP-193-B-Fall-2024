# Machine-Learning-Final-Project-COMP-193-B-Fall-2024
In this project, I analyze employee survey data to explore the relationship between the job satisfaction of sales managers and their working conditions. The primary goal is to predict satisfaction levels, enabling the company to identify signs of career stagnation among key employees or not obviously unoptimal working conditions which could be improved.

By leveraging these insights, the organization can implement timely and effective interventions to enhance employee satisfaction, improve retention, and address meaningful issues where feasible improvements can be made. 

Additionally, I will explore patterns across the three key satisfaction groups using K-means clustering and data visualization to gain deeper insights.

To use the Jupyter Notebook for this project, the following libraries must be installed: pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn. Each cell must be run in sequential order, as many subsequent cells depend on data uploaded or processed in the previous ones.
