# Machine-Learning-Final-Project-COMP-193-B-Fall-2024-
In this project, I will extract data from runners' profiles on the Strava app to cluster them into groups: ultramarathon, marathon, half-marathon, and sprinters, based on training style and volume. I will then analyze their interests from linked social media profiles to provide the most tailored advertisements for running equipment.
